This is the dataset for [Illumination modulation for reflective and fluorescent separation](https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-45-5-1120), Optics Letters 2019, by Ying Fu, Yunhao Zou, Liheng Bian, Yuxiang Guo, and Hua Huang.

## Optical System 
Considering that high frequency data can facilitate the separation of reflectance and fluorescence, we build a novel illumination modulation system, which can modulate an arbitrary off-the-shelf light source to a high frequency one. The optical system is independent of the spectral distribution of the original light source.

## Dataset
Using the above optical system, we capture several scenes with both reflective and fluorecent components. We provide the ```.mat``` format file in [BaiduDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZvCGumJhxZVjFwgYms3q5A), with the extraction code ```b87l```.

The images in ```Mat``` folder are the original high dimensional spectral data, and ```RGB``` folder contains simple RGB visualizations.
